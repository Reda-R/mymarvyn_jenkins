# MYMARVYN PROJECT
Welcome to my MyMarvyn project. The purpose of this project is to automate any task you want. During this project, I learned the bases of automating everyday developer tasks using Jenkins.


### PARTS OF THE PROJECT
- **Configuration as code (JCasC)**: used to describe the entire desired Jenkins configuration in just a single YAML file 
- **Job Domain Specific Language (Job DSL)**: used in order to create elements such
as jobs

### LAUNCH MY PROJECT
  ```sh
        chmod +x run.sh && ./run.sh
```
> Don't forget to launch docker before and have jenkins installed in your computer :)
